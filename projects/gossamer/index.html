        <h2>Darkroom v Lightroom Photograms, 2004-2014</h2>
        <p>
          Gossamer was started in 2004 while I was studying at Parsons School of
          Design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Misunderstanding the assignment, I showed up to class, held that day
          in the darkroom, unprepared. The request was that we bring something
          &mdash; that wasn't a negative &mdash; to put in the enlargers. What I
          happened to have in my bag was a hairnet that was used as a sort of
          bag for another project. Cramming that into the enlarger produced
          photograms very similar to what's below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not having access to an enlarger now, the current approach involves
          putting hairnets in my flatbed scanner.
