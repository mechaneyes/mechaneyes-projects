          <h3>Artist and technologist inducing delight online and off</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a visual artist and technologist based in Brooklyn. In 1994, via
            the mechanism of photography, I discovered a profound appreciation
            for light. I've spent the last 28 years collecting and projecting
            that light, in part having shaped that sensibility via the lens of
            Parsons School of Design.
          </p>
          <p>
            As much as I am enamored with art, I focus my attention equally on
            digital. It's when the two passions intersect that monkeys begin to
            dance.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a Senior Frontend Developer at UNIQLO I take projects from
            conceptualization, through prototyping and development and finally
            into production. Nights and weekends I spend immersed in personal
            projects. Under active development is Monolyth, a storytelling
            platform spanning simultaneous digital and physical touchpoints.
            Other recent work is actualized in AR/VR experiences, both mobile
            and immersive.
