        <h2>TBD Festival, 2015</h2>
        <p class="ital">Design + Development + Installation</p>
        <p>
          So I Do is a mobile web app I developed and installed at TBD Fest in
          Sacramento. It's a largely p5.js app that's networked to other phones
          running the app at the same time. The app operates as a communal
          drawing canvas whereby a mark made by one person on one phone is
          simultaneously displayed on all other phones running also running the
          app.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app was projected nearly 50 feet across on the underside of a tent
          in a lounge space at the fetival. By intereacting with the app, the
          users were able to change their visual background and thus the entire
          mood and atmosphere there, under the tent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to changes in iOS the app no longer plays nicely with iOS Safari
          out of the box. There are ways around this, so do reach out if you'd
          like me to share that with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          You're welcome to use the app with any projector in any environment.
